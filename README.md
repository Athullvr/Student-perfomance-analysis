# Student-perfomance-analysis
A beginner-friendly data analysis project using Kaggle’s Student Performance dataset. This project explores how factors like gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation impact student scores in math, reading, and writing. Includes EDA, visualizations, insights, and conclusions.

📊 Insights

Female students score higher in reading and writing compared to male students, showing a strong gender-based trend in language skills.

Male students slightly outperform in math, but the difference is smaller than the gap seen in reading and writing.

Parental education level strongly impacts student performance.
Students whose parents have college or master's degrees achieve higher scores across all subjects.

Lunch type is an indicator of performance.
Students with standard lunch score significantly higher than those with free/reduced lunch, reflecting socioeconomic influence.

Taking a test preparation course improves results, especially in math.
Students who completed the course generally outperform those who did not.

Reading and writing scores have the strongest correlation among all subject pairs, showing the close relationship between language skills.

Math and reading scores also show a positive correlation, meaning students strong in one subject tend to perform well in the other.

The dataset is clean, consistent, and has no major missing values, making it ideal for a beginner analysis project.


🧾 Conclusion

This analysis reveals that student performance is influenced by multiple social and academic factors.
Gender affects performance in language-related subjects, with female students excelling in reading and writing.
Parental education and lunch type show strong associations with overall academic success, suggesting the impact of family background and socioeconomic status.
Additionally, students who completed test preparation tend to score higher, emphasizing the value of structured study habits.

The correlations among subjects—especially between reading and writing—highlight how proficiency in one area supports performance in others.
Overall, this project provides meaningful insights into how background, support systems, and preparation shape student outcomes.
