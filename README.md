# 📘 **Student Performance Analysis — EDA Project**

📌 Overview

This project analyzes a student performance dataset to understand how factors like attendance, study hours, midterm grades, and student performance levels relate to overall academic outcomes.
The analysis includes visualizations, insights, and a conclusion based on the patterns found in the data.

# 📊 **Insights**


1️⃣ Gender Distribution

The dataset contains more Female and Male students compared to the Other category.

The distribution suggests a balanced representation between male and female participants.

This ensures that performance comparisons by gender are statistically reliable.


2️⃣ Attendance Percentage Distribution

Attendance is mostly clustered between 70% and 100%, with very few students below 60%.

Students generally show high attendance, indicating strong participation in academic activities.

A pattern of high attendance across students suggests good academic engagement in the dataset.


3️⃣ Midterm Grade vs Final Grade

The scatter plot shows a positive trend (as midterm grades increase, final grades also tend to increase).

Even though the points are spread widely, the overall pattern suggests that midterm performance is an indicator of final results.

Students with very low midterm scores rarely achieve high final grades, showing consistency in academic ability.


4️⃣ Study Hours per Week vs Student Performance

The box plot shows that Excellent and Good performers generally study more hours per week.

Poor performers tend to have lower median study hours, suggesting lack of consistent effort.

The spread of study time is higher among excellent students, which shows varied but overall higher commitment to studying.



# 🧾 **Conclusion**

This analysis highlights several key factors that influence student academic outcomes.
The data shows that students with higher study hours, better attendance, and strong midterm performance consistently achieve better final grades.
The positive relationship between midterm and final scores suggests that academic performance remains relatively stable throughout the term, and early performance can act as a reliable predictor of final results.

Additionally, the study hours vs. performance comparison demonstrates that top-performing students generally invest more time in studying, reinforcing the importance of consistent preparation.
The gender distribution appears balanced, ensuring that performance comparisons across genders are meaningful and unbiased.

Overall, the findings emphasize that regular attendance, consistent study habits, and steady performance across evaluations play a crucial role in determining academic success.
These insights can help educators and students understand the behaviors that lead to improvement and academic excellence.
